			Turbulent classed Logician was the result i got after completing the personaility test. At first i was rather skeptical about the result due different result a few years back prior. I decided to read through the information and came to to accept the result as through, realizing the strong connection through their ways of thinking and veiwing the world as well as how they percieve and interact with other vise versa. I find the information from 16 personalities to be valid in general for all that may be curious to try.

						Having an open mind to most things around me would be strongest strength due to my nonchalanance and relaxed personality.I'm greatful for it due to how it makes my day to day life enjoyable through new experieces, even leading me to start college earlier than planned and end up meeting facinating people and joining beneficial groups.
					</td>
					<td width ="30%" align="Left">
						I cant even imagine know where id be in life without my unrelenting imagination. It's one of those strentghs that i would usually forget to mention but without it i wouldnt be where i am today from small problems to even life risking situations my imagination has helped me. In recent years i have been using it more to help me be more creative in my projects .
					</td>
					<td width ="30%" align="Left">
						This strength has its positive and negative depending on the person and i have to admit ive been on the negative side many times without even realizing speaking what i think is right even though  the person would rather have comfort over a harsh truth. Many of these times where i have spoken my mind blunty ends up with positive results in the end, even resulting in people turing thier lif around.
